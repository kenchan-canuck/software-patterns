Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of generic methods, 
wildcard subtyping, and bounded subtyping to implement the 
Composition Pattern and the Inheritance Pattern. They leverage 
bounded wildcard and generic subtyping in conjunction with Java 
Collections.
 
    The value of these sample codes is to demonstrate the simplicity 
of implementing the Composition Pattern and the Inheritance Pattern
using bounded wildcard and generic subtyping in conjunction with 
Java Collections.
