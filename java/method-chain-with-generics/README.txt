Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of generic types to
implement method chaining.

     The value of method chaining is to allow a developer to 
invoke multiple sequential method calls of an object in one 
statement.  The method chaining pattern enables a developer to 
emulate sequential method invocations in one synchronous 
execution context.
