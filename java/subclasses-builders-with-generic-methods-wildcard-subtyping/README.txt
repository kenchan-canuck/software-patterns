Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of generic methods and
wildcard and bounded subtyping to implement the Builder Pattern
with complex inheritance hierarchy in conjunction with Java 
Collections.

    The value of these sample codes is to demonstrate the practicality
of implementing the Builder Pattern with a complex inheritance
hierachy using complex generic typing features in conjunction with
Java Collections. The goal is to maximize code reuse using advanced
linguistic features.
