Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of generic methods with 
complex subtyping and inheritance to implement the Builder Pattern.

    The advantage of these sample codes is that they can demonstrate 
the practicality of implementing the Builder Pattern with complex 
subtyping and multiple inherited classes.
