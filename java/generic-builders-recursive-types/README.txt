Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of recursive generic types
to implement the Builder Pattern with multiple inherited classes
and subtypes. 

    The benefit of these sample codes is that it is possible to 
implement Builder Pattern with multiple inherited classes using 
multiple subtypes and recursive generic types.
