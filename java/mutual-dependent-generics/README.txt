Purpose
=======
    These files contain sample java codes with java classes and
interfaces that illustrate the application of generic subtyping
on two mutually dependent classes or types.

    Two classes may have a mutual association relationship that
can be expressed via subtyping. These sample codes demonstrate
the simplicity of implementing this mutually dependent typing
pattern to maximize code reuse.
