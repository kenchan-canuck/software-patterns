Purpose
=======
    This repository contains sample codes in various C#
languages to implement a variety of Software Patterns which would
maximize code reuse.

    Many code samples use Generic Types (templates) and nested inner 
classes along with popular data structures to realize a variety of 
Software Patterns.  Some of the sample software patterns are 
Inheritance, Composition, Association, Builder, Method Chaining, 
Anonymous Classes, Lambda Expression and Functional Interface, and 
Generic API.  The goal of sharing the sample codes is to demonstrate
the practicality of leveraging advanced C# linguistic features
and common Software Patterns to maximize code reuse.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as
personal programming references only. Although all the sample codes
should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy
or cut and paste the code as is. The sample codes also include some
sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a
developer different perspectives on the experiment. These errors
also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature.

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play/experiment with
these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application
of them. A developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is
into his/her own code, instead he or she should develop his or her
own optimized version based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.

    Finally, the primary author and developer would like to share this
set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give
back. However, he does not claim to be a guru in various programming
languages. Therefore, all the contributors shall neither be accountable nor be
liable for any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.
