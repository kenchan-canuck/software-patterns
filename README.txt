Objectives
==========

    The author creates this open source code repository to maintain
a catalog of sample implementations of software patterns for the open
source commmunity.  He wants to encourage other developers to share 
their sample codes that may demonstrate a programming pattern, style,
best practices, or their interpretation of a design pattern or an
architecture pattern.


Rationale
=========

    YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MOST WELCOME! However, the author 
recommends contributors to develop sample codes that are unique and 
more "sophisticate" than other simpler sample codes found on the 
Internet and eBooks. Sample codes that show a combination 
of at least a few coding patterns, coding styles, and best practices 
tend to be valuable to many developers. 

    With a bigger catalog of quality sample codes, many developers 
will be able to solve their problems faster and to build their 
software faster and better as well. The benefit of code sharing is 
to put theory into practice. Sample codes often demonstrate the 
practicality of leveraging advanced programming linguistic features 
and common Software Patterns that can increase programming efficiency 
through code reuse and faster debugging.


Getting Started
===============
 
     This repository contains sample codes in various programming 
languages (e.g Java, Scala, etc) to implement a variety of Software 
Patterns using a variety of more advanced programming linguistic 
features. Many codes use Generic Types and nested inner classes 
along with popular data structures to realize a variety of Software
Patterns. Some of the sample software patterns are Inheritance, 
Composition, Association, Builder, Method Chaining, and Generic API. 

    The experiments focus primarily on compiler-based languages 
(e.g. Java, Scala, C++) rather than interpreter-based languages 
(e.g. Python, Ruby) because there are more intricacies to pass 
compiler-checks with advance grammar.  Also, compiler-based 
languages emphasize on early type check and static binding to 
reduce coding errors whereas interpreter-based languages 
(e.g. Python, Ruby, Javascript) emphasize on dynamic binding to 
reduce gramatical complexity and to catch coding errors at run-time. 
Nonetheless, there are no right answers to this topic.  The author 
would like to leave the debate on the pros and cons of compiler-based 
vs intepreter-based languages to the open source community to explore.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as
personal programming references only. Although all the sample codes
should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy
or cut and paste the code as is. The sample codes also include some 
sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a 
developer different perspectives on the experiment. These errors
also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she 
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature. 

Guidelines
==========

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play/experiment 
with these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and 
the application of them. A developer should not copy or cut and paste 
the code as is into his/her own code, instead he or she should develop 
his or her own optimized version based on his/her interpretation 
of the sample codes.  To practice good coding hygiene, please 
compile your sample code and run your unit tests successfully 
(e.g. with no error) before you submit (push) :)


Remarks
=======

    Finally, the author (and the developer) would like to share this 
set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give 
back. However, the author does not claim to be a guru in various 
programming languages. The author shall neither be accountable nor 
be liable for any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.

    All the codes in this repository are and will always be under 
Apache 2.0 Open Source License.  Feel free check out the website and 
the GitHub wiki on a regular basis. 

    Most importantly, please contribute your code to this repository 
or answer other developers' questions on this wiki!
