Purpose
=======
    This repository contains sample codes in various programming
languages (e.g Java, Scala, etc) to implement a variety of Software 
Patterns using a variety of more advanced programming linguistic 
features. Some features are Generic Types and nested inner classes 
along with popular data structures to realize a variety of Software 
Patterns. Some sample software patterns are Inheritace, Composition, 
Association, Builder, Method Chaining, and Generic API. 

     The goal of sharing the sample codes is to demonstrate the 
practicality of leveraging advanced programming linguistic features 
and common Software Patterns to increase programming efficiency 
through code reuse and faster debugging. The experiments focus
primarily on compiler-based languages (e.g. Java, Scala, C++) rather
than interpreter-based languages (e.g. Python, Ruby) because there 
are more intricacies to pass compiler-checks with advance grammar. 
Also, compiler-based languages emphasize on early type check and
static binding to reduce coding errors whereas interpreter-based
languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, Javascript) emphasize on dynamic 
binding to reduce grammatic complexity and to catch coding errors 
at run-time. Nonetheless, there are no right answers to this topic.
The author would like to leave the debate on the pros and cons of 
compiler-based vs intepreter-based languages to the open source 
community to explore.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as
personal programming references only. Although all the sample codes
should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy
or cut and paste the code as is. The sample codes also include some 
sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a 
developer different perspectives on the experiment. These errors
also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she 
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature. 

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play/experiment with
these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application
of them. A developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is
into his/her own code, instead he or she should develop his or her
own optimized version based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.

    Finally, the author (and the developer) would like to share this
set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give
back. However, the author does not claim to be a guru in various programming
languages. The author shall neither be accountable nor be liable for 
any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.
