Objectives
==========

    The primary author and developer created this open source code repository
and wiki, so the open source community would benefit from a comprehensive 
catalog of sample (reference) implementations of software patterns in the 
most popular Object-oriented languages (e.g. Java, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, C++,
C#, Go, Python, Ruby, and etc)

    He used the term "Software Patterns" to describe artifacts such as 
programming patterns, style, best practices, design patterns (Gang of Four),
or architectural patterns that are very useful to experienced developers.


Motivations
===========

    If Software Patterns are used properly, they tend to make their codes 
more concise (fewer lines of codes), to avoid re-invent the wheels (reuse),
to code faster, to reduce bugs, and to increase run-time performance.

    As an active developer, he was frustrated with random sample codes on 
the Internet (e.g. academic web pages, stackoverflow, developer blogs).

    Although he usually found some good quality answers on the Internet, 
it often took a lot longer than he would like. He also could not find any 
sites that have a comprehensive set of sample codes for reference.

    By having a centralized repository and wiki that contains a variety of 
working examples, he believes many developers like himself will be able to 
speed up their coding effort.

    He wants to encourage other developers to share their sample codes 
that may demonstrate a programming pattern, style, best practices, or 
their interpretation of a design pattern or an architecture pattern.

    With your help, this repository might become one of the most comprehensive 
"Software Pattern" Reference Code Repositories on the Internet some day!


Benefits
========

    YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MOST WELCOME!

    However, the primary author and developer recommends all the contributors 
to develop sample codes that are unique and more "sophisticate" than other 
simpler sample codes found on the Internet and eBooks.

    Sample codes that show a combination of at least a few coding patterns, 
coding style, and best practices tend to be valuable to many developers.

    With a bigger catalog of quality sample codes, many developers will be 
able to solve their problems faster and to build their software faster and 
better as well.

    The benefit of code sharing is to put theory into practice.
  
    Sample codes often demonstrate the practicality of leveraging advanced 
programming linguistic features and common Software Patterns that can 
increase programming efficiency through code reuse and faster debugging.


Getting Started
===============

    This repository contains sample codes in various programming languages 
(e.g Java, Scala, Kotlin, C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and etc) to implement a 
variety of Software Patterns using a variety of more advanced programming 
linguistic features.

    Many code samples use Generic Types and nested inner classes along with 
popular data structures to realize a variety of Software Patterns.

    Some of the sample software patterns are Inheritance, Composition, 
Association, Builder, Method Chaining, Anonymous Classes, Lambda Expression 
and Functional Interface, and Generic API.

    The experiments focus primarily on compiler-based languages (e.g. Java, 
Scala, C++) rather than interpreter-based languages (e.g. Python, Ruby) 
because there are more intricacies to pass compiler-checks with advance grammar.

    Also, compiler-based languages emphasize on early type check and static 
binding to reduce coding errors whereas interpreter-based languages (e.g. Python, 
Ruby, Javascript) emphasize on dynamic binding to reduce grammatical complexity 
and to catch coding errors at run-time.

    Nonetheless, there are no right or wrong answers in this topic. Instead of 
blindly following the herd (e.g. everyone uses python and it is hot), truly 
experienced software developers or architects simply needs to know what they 
need to accomplish and use the right tools to get the job done.

    Having said that, the author would like to leave the debate on the pros and 
cons of compiler-based versus interpreter-based languages to the open source 
community to explore.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as personal 
programming references only.

    Although all the sample codes should be compilable and executable, a 
developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is into his/her own code.

    The sample codes also include some sample erroneous programming expressions 
and statements to give a developer different perspectives on the experiment.

    These errors also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she 
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature.


Guidelines to Play
==================

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play or to experiment with these 
codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application of them.

    Just clone or download the code onto his or her local computer. Pick one of 
the pattern directories. Follow the instructions in the README.txt to compile 
the code and to run the generated executable(s).

    A developer may choose to modify his or her local copy of the code to experiment 
with other linguistic combinations.

    However, a developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is into his/her 
own project code, instead he or she should develop his or her own optimized version 
based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.


Guidelines to Contribute
========================

    Feel free to contribute to our projects!

    You may choose to provide your feedback through email or FAQ to improve our 
existing sample codes

    You may choose to extend our sample codes of the existing software patterns

    You may choose to add your own sample codes of a new software pattern

    You may choose to answer other developers' questions on this wiki!

    To practice good coding hygiene, please compile your sample code and run your 
unit tests successfully (e.g. with no error) before you submit (push) :)


Remarks
=======

    Finally, the primary author and developer would like to share this set of sample 
codes with the open source community as a way to give back.

    However, he does not claim to be a guru in various programming languages. All 
the contributors shall neither be accountable nor be liable for any form of damage 
resulting from the use of these codes.

    All the codes in this repository are and will always be under Apache 2.0 Open 
Source License.

    Feel free check out the website and the GitHub wiki on a regular basis.

    Most importantly, please contribute your code to this repository or answer 
other developers' questions on this wiki!
