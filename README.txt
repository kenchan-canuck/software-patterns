Purpose
=======
    The author creates this open source code repository to maintain
a catalog of sample implementations of software patterns in the open
source commmunity.  He wants to encourage other developers to share 
their sample codes that may demonstrate a programming pattern, style,
best practices, or their interpretation of a design and architecture
pattern.

     YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MOST WELCOME! To practice good coding 
hygience, please compile your sample code and and run your unit tests
(e.g. 100% pass) before you submit (push) :)

     The benefits of code sharing is to put theory into practice. 
Sample codes often demonstrate the practicality of leveraging advanced
programming linguistic features and common Software Patterns that 
can increase programming efficiency through code reuse and faster 
debugging. 
 
     This repository contains sample codes in various programming 
languages (e.g Java, Scala, etc) to implement a variety of Software 
Patterns using a variety of more advanced programming linguistic 
features. Some features are Generic Types and nested inner classes 
along with popular data structures to realize a variety of Software 
Patterns. Some sample software patterns are Inheritace, Composition, 
Association, Builder, Method Chaining, and Generic API. 

    The experiments focus primarily on compiler-based languages 
(e.g. Java, Scala, C++) rather than interpreter-based languages 
(e.g. Python, Ruby) because there are more intricacies to pass 
compiler-checks with advance grammar.  Also, compiler-based 
languages emphasize on early type check and static binding to 
reduce coding errors whereas interpreter-based languages 
(e.g. Python, Ruby, Javascript) emphasize on dynamic binding to 
reduce grammatic complexity and to catch coding errors at run-time. 
Nonetheless, there are no right answers to this topic.  The author 
would like to leave the debate on the pros and cons of compiler-based 
vs intepreter-based languages to the open source community to explore.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as
personal programming references only. Although all the sample codes
should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy
or cut and paste the code as is. The sample codes also include some 
sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a 
developer different perspectives on the experiment. These errors
also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she 
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature. 

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play/experiment with
these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application
of them. A developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is
into his/her own code, instead he or she should develop his or her
own optimized version based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.

    Finally, the author (and the developer) would like to share this
set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give
back. However, the author does not claim to be a guru in various programming
languages. The author shall neither be accountable nor be liable for 
any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.

    Feel free check out the website and the github wiki. Most importantly,
please contribute your code to this repostiory!
