Welcome to the Ken's Software Patterns!


Objectives
==========

    The creator and primary developer of this website created this open source code repository and wiki, so that the open source community would benefit from a comprehensive catalog of sample (reference) implementations of software patterns in the most popular object-oriented languages (e.g. Java, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, C++, C#, Go, Python, Ruby, and etc).

    He uses the term "software pattern" to represent a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring software problem within a given context, that could be very useful to experienced developers. A software pattern is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. It could be a programming best practices, a coding pattern, design pattern (Gang of Four), or architectural pattern.


Motivations
===========

    If a developer uses software patterns properly in his/her code, he/she would be able to make the code more concise (fewer lines of codes), to avoid re-inventing the wheel (reuse), to code faster, to reduce bugs, and to increase run-time performance.

    As an active coder, the creator of this repository was frustrated with random sample codes on the Internet (e.g. academic web pages, stackoverflow, developer blogs).

    Although he usually found some good quality answers on the Internet, it often took a lot longer than he would like. He also could not find any sites that had a comprehensive set of compilable sample codes for reference.

    By having a centralized repository and a wiki that contain a variety of working examples and references, he believes many developers like himself will be able to speed up their coding effort.

    He wants to encourage other developers to share their sample codes that may demonstrate a programming pattern, style, best practices, or their interpretation of a design pattern or architecture pattern.

    With your help, this repository might become one of the most comprehensive "Software Pattern" Reference Code Repositories on the Internet some day!


Benefits
========

    This repository provides developers with fully compilable and fully working (functional with no error) sample (reference) codes for more advanced programming linguistic features and common software patterns.

    However, the creator of this repository recommends all the contributors to develop sample codes that are unique and more "sophisticated" than other simpler sample codes found on the Internet and eBooks.

    Sample codes that show a combination of at least a few coding patterns, coding style, and best practices tend to be valuable to many developers.

    With a bigger catalog of quality sample codes, many developers would be able to solve their problems faster and build their software faster and better as well.

    The benefit of code sharing is to put theory into practice.

    Sample codes often demonstrate the practicality of leveraging advanced programming linguistic features and common Software Patterns that can increase programming efficiency through code reuse and faster debugging.


Getting Started
===============

    This repository contains sample codes in various programming languages (e.g Java, Scala, Kotlin, C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and etc) to implement a variety of Software Patterns using a variety of more advanced programming linguistic features.

    Many code samples use Generic Types and nested classes along with popular data structures to realize a variety of Software Patterns.

    Some of the sample software patterns are Inheritance, Composition, Association, Builder, Method Chaining, Anonymous Classes, Lambda Expression and Functional Interface, and Generic API.

    The experiments focus primarily on compiler-based languages (e.g. Java, Scala, C++) rather than interpreter-based languages (e.g. Python, Ruby) because there are more intricacies to pass compiler-checks with advance grammar.

    Also, compiler-based languages emphasize on early type check and static binding to reduce coding errors whereas interpreter-based languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, Javascript) emphasize on dynamic binding to reduce grammatical complexity and to catch coding errors at run-time.

    Nonetheless, there are no right or wrong answers in this topic. Instead of blindly following the herd (e.g. everyone uses python and it is hot), truly experienced software developers or architects simply needs to know what they need to accomplish and use the right tools to get the job done.

    Having said that, the author would like to leave the debate on the pros and cons of compiler-based versus interpreter-based languages to the open source community to explore.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as personal programming references only.

    Although all the sample codes should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is into his/her own code.

    The sample codes also include some sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a developer different perspectives on the experiment.

    These errors also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature.


Guidelines to Play
==================

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play or to experiment with these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application of them.

    Just clone or download the code onto his or her local computer. Pick one of the pattern directories. Follow the instructions in the README.txt to compile the code and to run the generated executable(s).

    A developer may choose to modify his or her local copy of the code to experiment with other linguistic combinations.

    However, a developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is into his/her own project code, instead he or she should develop his or her own optimized version based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.


Guidelines to Contribute
========================


    Feel free to contribute to our projects!

    You may choose to provide your feedback through email or FAQ to improve our existing content.

    You may choose to enhance or to extend our existing codes

    You may choose to add your own sample codes of a new software pattern.

    You may choose to add or update document/text files in our repository.

    You may choose to answer other developers' questions on this wiki!

    To practice good coding hygiene, please compile your sample code and run your unit tests successfully (e.g. with no error) before you submit (push) :)


Remarks
=======

    Finally, the creator of this repository would like to share this set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give back.

    However, he does not claim to be a guru in various programming languages. All the contributors shall neither be accountable nor be liable for any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.

    All the codes in this repository are and will always be under Apache 2.0 Open Source License.

    Feel free check out the website and the GitHub wiki on a regular basis.

    Most importantly, please contribute your code to this repository or answer other developers' questions on this wiki!

    Thank you!
