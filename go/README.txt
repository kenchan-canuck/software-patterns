Purpose
=======
    This repository contains sample codes in various Go
languages to implement a variety of Software Patterns which would 
maximize code reuse.

    The examples use a variety of more advanced Go linguistic
features such as Generic Types and nested inner classes along with
Go Collections to realize a variety of Software Patterns such as 
Inheritace, Composition, Association, Builder, Method Chaining, 
Lambda Expression and Functional Interface, and Generic API.  
The goal of sharing the sample codes is to demonstrate the 
practicality of leveraging advanced Go linguistic features 
and common Software Patterns to maximize code reuse.

    These codes are by no means optimized. They should be used as
personal programming references only. Although all the sample codes
should be compilable and executable, a developer should not copy
or cut and paste the code as is. The sample codes also include some 
sample erroneous programming expressions and statements to give a  
developer different perspectives on the experiment. These errors 
also serve as "exercises" for a developer to see if he or she 
understands the intricacies and the pitfalls of that linguistic feature. 

    It is highly recommended for a developer to play/experiment with
these codes, in order to learn/understand the pattern and the application
of them. A developer should not copy or cut and paste the code as is
into his/her own code, instead he or she should develop his or her 
own optimized version based on his/her interpretation of the sample codes.

    Finally, the author (and the developer) would like to share this
set of sample codes with the open source community as a way to give
back. However, the author does not claim to be a guru in various programming
languages. The author shall neither be accountable nor be liable for  
any form of damage resulting from the use of these codes.
